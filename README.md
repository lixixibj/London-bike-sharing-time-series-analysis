## Description

In this project, I went through tackling a multivariate time series problem using both statistical modeling and deep learning models. <br>
- Firstly, I did some exploratory data analysis to better understand the data and then I split the dataset into train and test sets. <br>
- Secondly, I try to check whether data is stationary or not because VAR model needs each feature to be stationary.<br>
- Finally, I am going to run both a lstm model and also a TCN model to make a comparison between the statistical models and deep learning ones. <br>

#### Techniques

- Time Series Analysis
	- Exploratory Data Analysis
	- Statistical Models
		- Vector autoregression (VAR)
	- Deep Learning
		- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
		- Temporal convolutional networks (TCN)
